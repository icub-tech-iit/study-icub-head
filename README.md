Study iCub Head
===============

## ðŸŒ¿ Repository structure
This repository is organized based upon the following multiple parallel (i.e. orphan in Git jargon) branches:
- ðŸ”˜ [`master`](../../tree/master) contains general information.
- ðŸ”˜ [`sim`](../../tree/sim) contains Simulink models for simulations.
- ðŸ”˜ [`code`](../../tree/code) contains code and configuration files.
- ðŸ”˜ [`mech`](../../tree/mech) contains mechanical drawings.

### ðŸ”½ How to clone specific branches locally
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/study-icub-head.git --single-branch --branch <branch-name>
```

Be careful that some branches (e.g. `master`, `mech`...) are handled via [Git LFS](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage).
