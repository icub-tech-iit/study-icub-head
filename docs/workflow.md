# a. Import CAD into simscape - full-fledged (focus on tendons) and simplified
In order to build the digital twin of the iCub head, we took advantage of Simscape Multibody Link to export the CAD assembly from PTC Creo. The CAD assembly allows for accurate computation of the inertias and masses involved for simulation. In return, the Simscape representation can provide insight on the kinematics and the dynamics.
